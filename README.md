# Live-vs-Studio-Classifier-From-YouTube-Comments
This routine classifies a video for a song as being from a live or studio performance using YouTube comments

The current version uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier that was trained on 35,000+ comments that I extracted from all of Opeth's discography. The accuracy of the model is currently at 82.2%. However, I need to expand the artists and genres to make the classifier more robust. Shoot me a message on LinkedIn or Twitter if you'd like to help out!

You can see the current version of the classifier in the Streamlit app that I made here:
